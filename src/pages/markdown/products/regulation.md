Each set is custom-made and handmade according to your specifications following American Cornhole Association guidelines. We use top-quality wood to build our sets. Sets come complete with 8 bags (choose 2 colors from the bag options). We do not use pressed board on our Cornhole Games. Each unit is made with 1/2" B/C plywood that's been sanded smooth. We then stain with your choice of stain colors and apply 2 coats of polyurethane. Collapsible legs help you pack them for a trip and setup quickly to begin play.

**Most orders ship in 48 hours.**
