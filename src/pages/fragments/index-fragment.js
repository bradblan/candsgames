      We are proud to produce high quality custom-made Cornhole games and
      accessories in Bowling Green, KY. Our full-size Cornhole games are made to
      American Cornhole Association regulations, using only quality 1/2" plywood
      on a 2" x 4" frame. Each finished game is stained and coated with
      Polyurethane for maximum durability.

      Each Cornhole game set you purchase is custom-made at our in-house
      facilities. We hand select each piece of wood that goes into our games and
      custom inspect every unit before it goes out to you. Our regulation duck
      cloth bags are produced and sewn here as well. No product ships without
      our inspection!
