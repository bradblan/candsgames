    <h1>About C &amp; S Games</h1>
    <p>
      Charlie and Sara began building Cornhole games when they saw that a friend
      had a set. With Charlie being the craftsman that he is, he had the
      materials, knowledge, tools and the passion to build a superior Cornhole
      game. Charlie set out to do just that... and he did! While Charlie was
      busy perfecting his Cornhole game design, Sara got busy with her sewing
      machine and developed a fashionable and durable Cornhole bag to go along
      with Charlie's design.

      Their new Cornhole games, complete with a set of rules, were initially
      used as gifts to family members and friends. That's when the word started
      to spread. Charlie and Sara began receiving phone calls from strangers
      telling their stories of how they were playing Cornhole at someone's house
      and wanted to know who made such great games. Charlie and Sara quickly
      learned that they had a great product on their hand, and they became C
      &amp; S Games.

      Nowadays, you'll find Charlie in his workshop working constantly building
      Cornhole games, and Sara is still fast at work on the sewing machine
      making bags. Their commitment to excellence and ensuring that each game
      they sell adheres to strict American Cornhole Association standards has
      enabled Charlie and Sara to develop a customer base from coast to coast.

      "We hope that you will enjoy playing these games as much as we enjoy
      making them!"
